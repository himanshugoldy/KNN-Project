# KNN-Project
KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry.
The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other.
# Choosing the right value for K
  To select the K that’s right for your data, we run the KNN algorithm several times with different values of K and choose the K that reduces the number of errors we encounter while maintaining the algorithm’s ability to accurately make predictions when it’s given data it hasn’t seen before.
